# IO-Model-Solver
This is a project in C++ (Eclipse IDE), that I developed as an undergraduate and expanded as a postgrad. It follows the IO literature and solves Cournot, Bertrand and Stackelberg models based on the user's input. The pdf files included show the project's inital state - undergrad assignment - as it was in 2016. Some of the files are in Greek. Starting this in 2016, I developed it in Codeblocks, then transitioned to Eclipse Mars and reffered only in solving Cournot models. As time passed by, I expanded the solutions to all 3 common IO models and tranfered the project files into Eclipse IDE. An interface and a proper app are on the way.
